TypeScript is nothing but it ensures the type safety in javascript
for ex:
it don't allows something unusal like 2 + '2' = '22' // TypeScript will not allow this type conversion 
check ss1 for what TS stops:

TypeScript is static checking it means that iw works like when we are working with C++ in IDEs, as it that whenever we are doing a mistake the error is thrown at taht time only by the IDE itself
That's what TS does. Check ss2 for that

To install TypeScript do: npm install -g typescript
